Gross Margin = unit price * quantity - unit cost x quantity

GM% = (unit price * quantity - unit cost x quantity) / (unit price x quantity) --> GM% = (Unit price - unit cost)/ Unit price

GM% ~ Unit Price / Unit Cost

If unit cost goes down, gross margin percentage goes up

If unit price goes down, gross margin percentage goees down
